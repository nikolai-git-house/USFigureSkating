# TESTS
Tests are currently in a rudimentary form and not part of a comprehensive test suite. 

In order to run a test locally, import the appropriate test function into main.ts, then call it in the `created` function.  

Build site assets, open in a web browser and look for test output in the developer tools javascript console.
