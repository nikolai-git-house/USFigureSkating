## Cookies
This page relies on the cookies (team_id and competition_id) defined in `INTEGRATION_GUIDES/Release3/TeamRegistrationAndPortal/TeamRegistration/INTEGRATION-TeamRegistrationRegistrationShell.md:10` in
order to construct API endpoint URLs.

## Changes to Existing Files
To support the addition of this page, core functionality from SPD Competition Registration has been extracted into a mixin.

    * Following extraction, component code has been updated to hook into mixin code
`src/sass/components/competition-registration/components/_event-card.scss`
    * New element has been added to `.event-card` block.
`src/sass/components/competition-registration/pages/_competition-registration-event-selection.scss`

## API
The following API endpoints are relevant to this step

### Fetch Event Selection

**Purpose:** Fetch data required to power the Event Selection Page

**Source:** Team Registration SPA Event Selection Page load

**URL:** `GET: /api/competition-registration/competitions/{competition_id}/teams/{team_id}/events`

**Request Payload:** `none`

**Response:** `TeamRegistrationApi.FetchEventSelectionApiResponse`

**Notes:**
1. If the current user does not have sufficient permissions to view the information, or if the information canâ€™t be found, a non-2xx HTTP response code should be returned and the page will display a generic message ("Error loading event selection.").
1. The URL for this endpoint contains segments for the active team and competition IDs.  The client side relies on the cookies
mentioned above in order to construct these URLs.
1. In the case where only a single event is available for selection, the page will not load or perform differently from when there are multiple events available.

### Remove Event

**Purpose:** Remove an event from the team's selections

**Source:** Team Registration SPA Event Selection Page remove event button click

**URL:** `DELETE: /api/competition-registration/competitions/{competition_id}/teams/{team_id}/events/{event_id}`

**Request Payload:** `none`

**Response:** `TeamRegistrationApi.RemoveEventApiResponse`

**Notes:**
1. If the submission is unsuccessful, an error message will display in the UI. If a 2xx response code is sent with a value in the response `error` key, the provided message will display.
   Otherwise, a generic message will display (`Error removing event.`)
2. To align with participant Competition Registration, the updated list of events following the removal is included in the response.  Added and selected events need to be included in this response set.
